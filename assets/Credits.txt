Game design, level design, programming, art, and animation by Joseph Cloutier (player_03). Additional art by Alex Ostroff, including the original character design.

Thanks to whoever made the soundtrack, even if we don't know who you are.

Thanks to Kongregate and Coolmath Games, and all the other sites that have worked with me over the years.

Extra special thanks to the Run community for your support over all these years. You are all amazing.
